9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for
Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type.
Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of

information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
cating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
butes individually, and then call both methods.

9-2. Three Restaurants: Start with your class from Exercise 9-1. Create three
different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each
instance.
9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
a personalized greeting to the user.

Create several instances representing different users, and call both meth-
ods for each user.
